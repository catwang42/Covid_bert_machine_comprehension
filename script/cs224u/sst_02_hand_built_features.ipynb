    "## Basic optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now in a position to begin training supervised models!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, in this course, we will not study the theoretical aspects of machine learning optimization, concentrating instead on how to optimize systems effectively in practice. That is, this isn't a theory course, but rather an experimental, project-oriented one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, we do want to avoid treating our optimizers as black boxes that work their magic and give us some assessment figures for whatever we feed into them. That seems irresponsible from a scientific and engineering perspective, and it also sends the false signal that the optimization process is inherently mysterious. So we do want to take a minute to demystify it with some simple code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `np_sgd_classifier` contains a complete optimization framework, as `BasicSGDClassifier`. Well, it's complete in the sense that it achieves our full task of supervised learning. It's incomplete in the sense that it is very basic. You probably wouldn't want to use it in experiments. Rather, we're going to encourage you to rely on `sklearn` for your experiments (see below). Still, this is a good basic picture of what's happening under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is `BasicSGDClassifier` doing? The heart of it is the `fit` function (reflecting the usual `sklearn` naming system). This method implements a hinge-loss stochastic sub-gradient descent optimization. Intuitively, it works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by assuming that all the feature weights are `0`.\n",
    "1. Move through the dataset instance-by-instance in random order.\n",
    "1. For each instance, classify it using the current weights. \n",
    "1. If the classification is incorrect, move the weights in the direction of the correct classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This process repeats for a user-specified number of iterations (default `10` below), and the weight movement is tempered by a learning-rate parameter `eta` (default `0.1`). The output is a set of weights that can be used to make predictions about new (properly featurized) examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more technical terms, the objective function is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\min_{\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}}\n",
    "  \\sum_{(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{D}} \n",
    "  \\max_{y'\\in\\mathbf{Y}}\n",
    "  \\left[\\mathbf{Score}_{\\textbf{w}, \\phi}(x,y') + \\mathbf{cost}(y,y')\\right] - \\mathbf{Score}_{\\textbf{w}, \\phi}(x,y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{w}$ is the set of weights to be learned, $\\mathcal{D}$ is the training set of example&ndash;label pairs, $\\mathbf{Y}$ is the set of labels, $\\mathbf{cost}(y,y') = 0$ if $y=y'$, else $1$, and $\\mathbf{Score}_{\\textbf{w}, \\phi}(x,y')$ is the inner product of the weights \n",
    "$\\mathbf{w}$ and the example as featurized according to $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fit` method is then calculating the sub-gradient of this objective. In succinct pseudo-code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{0}$\n",
    "* Repeat $T$ times:\n",
    "    * for each $(x,y) \\in \\mathcal{D}$ (in random order):\n",
    "        * $\\tilde{y} = \\text{argmax}_{y'\\in \\mathcal{Y}} \\mathbf{Score}_{\\textbf{w}, \\phi}(x,y') + \\mathbf{cost}(y,y')$\n",
    "        * $\\mathbf{w} =  \\mathbf{w} + \\eta(\\phi(x,y) - \\phi(x,\\tilde{y}))$\n",
    "        \n",
    "This is very intuitive – push the weights in the direction of the positive cases. It doesn't require any probability theory. And such loss functions have proven highly effective in many settings. For a more powerful version of this classifier, see [sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier).
