    "## Starting up\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you have followed the [course setup](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cgpotts/cs224u/blob/master/setup.ipynb) instructions. This means Jupyter is installed using Conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows). \n",
    "2. Enter a directory that you'd like to have as your `Home`, e.g., where your cloned `cs224u` Github repo resides. \n",
    "3. Type `jupyter notebook` and enter. After a few moments, a new browser window should open, listing the contents of your `Home` directory. \n",
    "    - Note that on your screen, you'll see something like `[I 17:23:47.479 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/`. This tells you where your notebook is located. So if you were to accidentally close the window, you can open it again while your server is running. For this example, navigating to `http://localhost:8888/` on your favorite web browser should open it up again. \n",
    "    - You may also specify a port number, e.g. `jupyter notebook --port 5656`. In this case, `http://localhost:5656/` is where your directory resides. \n",
    "4. Click on a notebook with `.ipynb` extension to open it. If you want to create a new notebook, in the top right corner, click on `New` and under `Notebooks`, click on `Python`. If you have multiple environments, you should choose the one you want, e.g. `Python [nlu]`. \n",
    "    - You can rename your notebook by clicking on its name (originally \"Untitled\") at the top of the notebook and modifying it. \n",
    "    - Files with `.ipynb` are formatted as a JSON and so if you open them in vim, emacs, or a code editor, it's much harder to read and edit. \n",

    "Cells help you organize your work into manageable chunks. \n",

    "The top of your notebook contains a row of buttons. If you hover over them, the tooltips explain what each one is for: saving, inserting a new cell, cut/copy/paste cells, moving cells up/down, running/stopping a cell, choosing cell types, etc. Under Edit, Insert, and Cell in the toolbar, there are more cell-related options. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the bar on the left of the cell changes color depending on whether you're in edit mode or command mode. This is useful for knowing when certain keyboard shortcuts apply (discussed later). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of cells: **code**, **markdown**, and raw. \n",
    "\n",
    "Raw cells are less common than the other two, and you don't need to understand them to get going for this course. If you put anything in this type of cell, you can't run it. They are used for situations where you might want to convert your notebook to HTML or LaTeX using the `nbconvert` tool or File -> Download as a format that isn't `.ipynb`. Read more about raw cells [here](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.2/raw-cells.html) if you're curious. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following code cells to explore various operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically it's good practice to put import statements in the first cell or at least in their own cell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The square brackets next to the cell indicate the order in which you run cells. If there is an asterisk, it means the cell is currently running. \n",
