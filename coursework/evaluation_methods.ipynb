    "### Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter optimization is one of the most important parts machine learning, and a crucial part of building a persuasive argument. To see why, it's helpful to imagine that you're in an ongoing debate with a very skeptical referee:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You ran experiments with models A, B, and C. For each, you used the default hyperparameters as given by the implementations you're using. You found that C performed the best, and so you reported that in your paper.\n",
    "1. Your reviewer doesn't have visibility into your process, and maybe doesn't fully trust you. Did you try any other values for the hyperparameters without reporting that? If not, would you have done that if C hadn't outperformed the others? There is no way for the reviewer (or perhaps anyone) to answer these questions.\n",
    "1. So, from the reviewer's perspective, all we learned from your experiments is that there is some set of hyperparameters on which C wins this competition. But, strictly speaking, this conveys no new information; we knew before you did your experiments that we could find settings that would deliver this and all other outcomes. (They might not be __sensible__ settings, but remember you're dealing with a hard-bitten, unwavering skeptic.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our best response to this situation is to allow these models to explore a wide range of hyperparameters, choose the best ones according to performance on training or development data, and then report how they do with those settings at test time. __This gives every model its best chance to succeed.__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do this, the strongest argument that your skeptical reviewer can muster is that you didn't pick the right space of hyperparameters to explore for one or more of the models. Alas, there is no satisfying the skeptic, but we can at least feel happy that the outcome of these experiments will have a lot more scientific value than the ones described above with fixed hyperparameters."

    "### The ideal hyperparameter optimization setting\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating a model, the ideal regime for hyperparameter optimization is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each hyperparameter, identify a large set of values for it. \n",
    "2. Create a list of all the combinations of all the hyperparameter values. This will be the [cross-product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of all the values for all the features identified at step 1.\n",
    "3. For each of the settings, cross-validate it on the available training data.\n",
    "4. Choose the settings that did best in step 3, train on all the training data using those settings, and then evaluate that model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very demanding. First, The number of settings grows quickly with the number of hyperparameters and values. If hyperparameter $h_{1}$ has $5$ values and hyperparameter $h_{2}$ has $10$, then the number of settings is $5 \\cdot 10 = 50$. If we add a third hyperparameter $h_{3}$ with just $2$ values, then the number jumps to $100$. Second, if you're doing 5-fold cross-validation, then each model is trained 5 times. You're thus committed to training $500$ models.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it could get worse. Suppose you don't have a fixed train/test split, and you're instead reporting, say, the result of 10 random train/test splits. Strictly speaking, the optimal hyperparameters could be different for different splits. Thus, for each split, the above cross-validation should be conducted. Now you're committed to training $5,000$ systems!"

If we adopted it, then complex models trained on large datasets would end up disfavored, and only the very wealthy would be able to participate. Here are some pragmatic steps you can take to alleviate this problem, in descending order of attractiveness. (That is, the lower you go on this list, the more likely the skeptic is to complain!)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Bergstra and Bengio (2012)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/bergstra12a.html) argue that __randomly sampling__ from the space of hyperparameters delivers results like the full \"grid search\" described above with a relatively few number of samples. __Hyperparameter optimization algorithms__ like those implemented in [Hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/) and [scikit-optimize](https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize) allow guided sampling from the full space. All these methods control the exponential growth in settings that comes from any serious look at one's hyperparameters. \n",

    "### Early stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "The above plot of dev-set performance suggests a simple strategy of __early stopping__: identify the iteration $i$ at which dev-set performance peaked and train our models for exactly $i$ iterations when doing our final test-set run. This value $i$ can be set differently for different models; selecting this point could even be done automatically during [hyperparameter](#Hyperparameter-optimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is important to test the same model that is being used to create the dev-set performance curve, then one needs to store all the model parameters for the currently best model and then \"rewind\" to that stage once one decides that further training isn't helping. This is arguably the safest thing to do, since it keeps the actual parameters that maximized dev-set performance; see below on [the impact of random initializations](#The-role-of-random-parameter-initialization).\n",

    "\n",
    "I frankly think the best response to all this is to accept that incremental performance plots like the above are how we should be assessing our models. This exposes all of the variation that we actually observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in deep learning, we're often dealing with classes of models that are in principle capable of learning anything. The real question is implicitly how efficiently they can learn given the available data and other resources. Learning curves bring this our very clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can improve the curves by adding confidence intervals to them derived from repeated runs. Here's a plot from a paper I recently wrote with Nick Dingwall ([Dingwall and Potts 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09901)):\n",

    "I think this shows very clearly that, once all is said and done, the Mittens model (red) learns faster than the others, but is indistinguishable from the Clinical text GloVe model (blue) after enough training time. Furthermore, it's clear that the other two models are never going to catch up in the current experimental setting. A lot of this information would be lost if, for example, we decided to stop training when dev set performance reached its peak and report only a single F1 score per class."

    "## The role of random parameter initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Most deep learning models have their parameters initialized randomly, perhaps according to some heuristics related to the number of parameters ([Glorot and Bengio 2010](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html)) or their internal structure ([Saxe et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6120)). This is meaningful largely because of the non-convex optimization problems that these models define, but it can impact simpler models that have multiple optimal solutions that still differ at test time. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is growing awareness that these random choices have serious consequences. For instance, [Reimers and Gurevych (2017)](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/D17-1035/d17-1035) report that different initializations for neural sequence models can lead to statistically significant results, and they show that a number of recent systems are indistinguishable in terms of raw performance once this source of variation is taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shouldn't surprise practitioners, who have long struggled with the question of what to do when a system experiences a catastrophic failure as a result of unlucky initialization. (I think the answer is to report this failure rate.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet below lets you experience this phenomenon for yourself. The XOR logic operator, which is true just in case its two arguments have the same value, is famously not learnable by a linear classifier but within reach of a neural network with a single hidden layer and a non-linear activation function ([Rumelhart et al. 1986](https://www.nature.com/articles/323533a0)). But how consistently do such models actually learn XOR? No matter what settings you choose, you rarely if ever see perfect performance across multiple runs."

[Confidence intervals](#Confidence-intervals) and [statistical tests](#Wilcoxon-signed-rank-test) can be used to summarize the variation observed. If the evaluation regime already involves comparing the results of multiple train/test splits, then ensuring a new random initializing for each of those would seem sufficient.\n",

However, [as discussed above](#Practical-considerations,-and-some-compromises), we have to be realistic. If multiple run aren't feasible, then a more heuristic argument will be needed to try to convince skeptics that the differences observed are larger than we would expect from just different random initializations."

    "## Closing remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize most of the above with a few key ideas:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Your evaluation should be based around a few systems that are related in ways that illuminate your hypotheses and help to convey what the best models are learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every model you assess should be given its best chance to shine (but we need to be realistic about how many experiments this entails!).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The test set should play no role whatsoever in optimization or model selection. The best way to ensure this is to have the test set locked away until the final batch of experiments that will be reported in the paper, but this separation is simulated adequately by careful cross-validation set-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Strive to base your model comparisons in multiple runs on the same splits. This is especially important for deep learning, where a single model can perform in very different ways on the same data, depending on the vagaries of optimization."
